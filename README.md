# An analysis of music industry data

## Overview

We examine data about the music industry. We estimate an Bayesian hierarchical model which explains their attributes based on their functionality.

The repo is structured as:

DanielK95, faraharthur, and Riley Irie Ramirez.
-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `model` contains fitted models. 
-   `other` contains relevant literature, details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.


## Statement on LLM usage

Some aspects of the code were written with the help of ChatGPT and the entire chat history is available in inputs/llms/usage.txt.
